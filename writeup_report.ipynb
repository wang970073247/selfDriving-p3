    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "First,i use a Keras lambda layer to normalize the data(model.py line 43 ).\n",
    "Next,the model consists of 5 convolution neural networks(model.py lines 47-51),they are:\n",
    "  CNN layer1:filter sizes(5x5), stride(2x2), activation(relu), depth(24) \n",
    "  CNN layer2:filter sizes(5x5), stride(2x2), activation(relu), depth(36) \n",
    "  CNN layer3:filter sizes(5x5), stride(2x2), activation(relu), depth(48)\n",
    "  CNN layer4:filter sizes(3x3), activation(relu), depth(64) \n",
    "  CNN layer5:filter sizes(3x3), activation(relu), depth(64)\n",
    "Third,the model has a flatten layer and four fully connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 62 ). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track,and i try different values of the epoch parameter to avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py lines 61-62), and to get better model i use the right images and left images from multiple cameras,also with a correction parameter which can be turned\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used the udacity's data(data.zip),besides i also pick some more training data and add them to the udacity's data. Because when i only use udacity's data, i find the car cannot run well in one of the three sharp corners and on the bridge. so i collect some data when the car in the corner and on the bridge, and i also make the car run counter-clockwise, pick one more round data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used a multiple cameras data.\n",
